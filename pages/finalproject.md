The word *除菌* (*jyokin*, which means sterilising) is something you can often see on products and hear in commercials in Japan.  All bacteria is considered “evil” when the truth is we are covered with millions of microbiota and we wouldn’t be able to live without this symbiotic relationship. I’m really interested in what we can learn from the microbes about ourselves and the environment. Can we observe the subtle changes in our everyday lives and maybe even visualise our health or mental state? This project is an attempt to collect the microbes both on humans and in the surrounding environment and use it as a living material to grow on jewellery so that it will reflect how we are and where we are.

Right now I am making rings out of agar to sample microbes from the finger and from the environment. I am also making earrings with pieces of agar to sample microbes from different locations.
